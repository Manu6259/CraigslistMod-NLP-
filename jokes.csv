If what Clinton did was so bad, why didn't Bush fix it? He had nearly 8 years to do so. Note that the VAST majority of the mortgages that defaulted were created when Bush was president. And BTW, who wrote the bill that repealed Glass-Steagall? GRAHAM (R), LEACH (R) and BLILEY(R). ALL Republicans. But, what really caused it were the actions of greedy lenders, who sold mortgages to anyone, then repackaged them (because they could, under Graham-Leach-Bliley) with other financial products so they can get them off their hands like hot potatoes before they imploded. See? Without the regulations of Glass-Steagall, crooked lenders had a free-for-all. That's one of the consequences of ""small government"" and ""less pesky regulations.""

The Fed responded by cutting interest rates to the lowest levels since Bretton Woods to stimulate the economy. The Fed held interest rates low through mid-2004. Combined with federal policy to encourage homeownership, low interest rates helped spark a boom in real estate and financial markets and a dramatic expansion of the volume of total mortgage debt.

They're white, they're sold by the dozen, and every week you have to buy more. A pro-shop gets its name from the fact that you have to have the income of a professional golfer to buy anything in there. It's amazing how a golfer who never helps out around the house will replace his divots, repair his ball marks, and rake his sand traps. When you stop to think about it, did you ever notice that it's a lot easier to get up at 6:00 a.m. to play golf than at 10:00 a.m. to mow the lawn? It takes longer to learn good golf than it does brain surgery. On the other hand, you seldom get to ride around on a cart, drink beer, and eat hot dogs while performing brain surgery. A good drive on the 18th hole has stopped many a golfer from giving up the game. Golf is the perfect thing to do on Sunday because you always end up praying a lot. A good golf partner is one who's always slightly worse than you. That rake by the sand trap is there for golfers who feel guilty about skipping out on lawn work. If your opponent has trouble remembering whether he shot a six or a seven, he probably shot an eight. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334606169",0,TRUE,3,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334606169

And, since in Judaism a Jewish wife is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to consult the Rabbi. The Rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes the following suggestion: ""Hire a strapping young man, to watch you having sex... give him a towel and while the two of you are making love, have the young man wave the towel over you both... That will help your wife fantasize and should bring on an orgasm."" They go home and follow the Rabbi's advice. They hire a handsome young man with a great build... and he waves a towel over them as they make love... But. it does not help and the wife is still unsatisfied. Perplexed, they go back to the Rabbi, the husband says it didn't work."" And the Rabbi says... ""Okay,' then try it reversed... Have the young man make love to your wife and you wave the towel over them."" Once again, they follow the Rabbi's advice. They go home, they hire the same strapping young man... and tell him what he must do... The young man gets into bed with the wife and gets to work with great enthusiasm as the husband waves the towel... Soon the wife is in the throws of passion and she has an enormous, room shaking, ear-splitting screaming orgasm!!!. Afterward... the husband stands next to the bed with the towel and a big smile... As he looks at his wife, who is still shaking from her experience, and he looks at the young man, he says triumphantly... ""You see that, you schmuck?!? THAT is how you wave a towel...l!!"" https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334604048",0,TRUE,3,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334604048

(only 4 question < HaveYaHeard > 2025-04-22 08:09 (only 4 questions this year) Ready? Have a go at it Yep, it's that time of year again for us to take our annual senior citizen test. Exercise of the brain is as important as exercise of the muscles. As we grow older, it‚Äôs important to keep mentally alert. If you don‚Äôt use it, you will lose it !!! Here is a very private way to gauge how your memory compares to your last test. Some may think it is too easy, but the ones with memory problems may have difficulty. Take this test to determine if you‚Äôre losing it or not. The spaces below are so you don‚Äôt see the answers until you‚Äôve answered. OK, RELAX, clear your mind and begin. #1. What do you put in a toaster ? Answer: 'bread.' If you said 'toast', just give up now and go do something else. And, try not to hurt yourself. If you said, bread, go to Question #2. # 2. Say 'silk' ten times. Now spell 'silk.' What do cows drink ? Answer: Cows drink water. If you said 'milk,' don't attempt the next question. Your brain is already over-stressed and may even overheat. Content yourself with reading more appropriate literature such as Women's Weekly or Auto World. However, if you did say 'water', proceed to Question #3. # 3. If a red house is made from red bricks and a blue house is made from blue bricks and a pink house is made from pink bricks and a black house is made from black bricks, what is a green house made from ? Answer: Greenhouses are made from glass. If you said 'green bricks', why are you still reading this ??? PLEASE, go lie down ! But, if you said 'glass,' go on to Question #4. # 4. Please do not use a calculator for this for it would be cheating: You are driving a bus from New York City to Philadelphia. In Staten Island, 17 people got on the bus. In New Brunswick, 6 people get off the bus and 9 people get on. In Windsor, 2 people get off and 4 get on. In Trenton, 11 people get off and 16 people get on. In Bristol, 3 people get off and 5 people get on. And, in Camden, 6 people get off and 3 get on. You then arrive at Philadelphia Station. Without going back to review, how old is the bus driver ?

That part is still WAY beyond your peabrain comprehension.) >>>The speed of electrons in metals is actually very high, around 105ms‚àí1 .
