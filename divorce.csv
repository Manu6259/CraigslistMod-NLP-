divorce,6,6,Fathers advice going into court the 1st time,KCMOBoards,2025/3/14 9:45,"reply to this post rate flag Fathers advice going into court the 1st time < KCMOBoards > 2025-03-14 09:45 FATHERS ADVICE Go to the Courthouse and FILL out your own child support worksheet where you get DIRECT EXPENSES. It'll show much LESS that you will be obligated for. Get Temporary orders for the mother to stay in the same place, town, school district that you currently live in so she does not move away with the kids. – This is very important. You will also want this in your final parenting plan. Also have it spelled out, that if the Mother moves out of the kids school district, that Father gets primary custody and Mother pays child support. If she breaks it, then take her back to court for primary custody. DO NOT give your kids mom any money directly, it can be counted as a gift and you may have to pay her again. Only pay through the court. Ask for the Child Support payment office address and send the money there with your case # on it. Including your COUNTY. DO NOT talk about any other sources of income other than your paycheck, nothing else. Freeze your credit report Close all your bank accounts and make new ones just for YOURSELF. If your Kids have bank accounts, empty them, close their accounts, and hide the money. Once divorce is completed, reopen your kids accounts with YOUR Name only. (My exwife cleaned out my kids bank accounts and closed them) Close all credit cards & reopen in your name only DO NOT GIVE HER ACCESS TO ANY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS Whatever you do, DO NOT Give up DIRECT EXPENSES. You as the Father WANT DIRECT EXPENSES for your child. That way they can participate in clubs, camps, lessons, activities, sports, etc DEMAND that you get DIRECT EXPENSES, and 50/50 equal parenting Time. (THIS WILL CUT your Child support by almost 80%!!!!) Explanation of DIRECT EXPENSES: Direct expenses for a child shall include those fixed expenses paid directly to a third party, such as a school, church, recreational club, or sports club to allow participation in an activity or event, or to attend school. Direct expenses also include all necessary supplies and equipment purchased to support such activity. Direct expenses shall include: • All school and school-related expenses including school lunches. • Extracurricular activities. • Clothing. Do not accept any visitor or visitation status. You are NOT a visitor to your Child, you are their father and you have just as much right to them as your ex does. Parenting Plan - I recommend a 2 2 3 plan. You get every Monday and Tuesday and then every other weekend, she gets every Wednesday and Thursday and every other weekend. School Pick Up – ONLY pick up on your days, Make your ex do their part and pick up kids on their days. Daycare – Daycare expenses should be split 50 / 50. DO NOT PAY YOUR EX DIRECTLY FOR ANY DAYCARE COSTS. HOLIDAYS - Split Holidays, birthdays and ask that you get your child on your birthday and Veterans day the entire 24 hour period. On their birthday you and your ex split every other year. TAXES - Ask for and Demand that you split the tax deduction every other year, that way you both benefit from it. Communication APP – Demand that you use a court approved App for communication and exchange of Bills: OurFamilyWizard or Co-Parentor are the 2 Apps that I know. Anti-Family Courts recognize these Apps for Official documents and communications. Check dating websites, sugar daddy websites (seeking arrangements), see if your ex is earning income on the downlow (ebay, poshmark, mercari, Craigslist, Facebook), hell check Reddit too for areas in your City, County, State. She may be earning money on the side and hiding it from you. Subpoena your ex's workplace directly for a copy of her paystub. That way you have the employers copy and not one your ex provided and edited. AND above all, put your kids first in everything you do. Keep all conversations ONLY about your child(ren) with your ex. Download call recording software on your phone to record every phone call with her Buy and wear a body camera / Dash Camera / Cellphone and record every interaction with her. Check your City, County, State traffic, civil court and criminal court for any tickets or records she may have and get copies. Check her drivers license against the state Drivers License registration if you can to see if she's driving on a suspended license, expired tags or no insurance. If she is, she's putting your child in danger and they shouldn't be riding with her. And one last piece of advice, DO NOT GIVE HER ANY MONEY DIRECTLY. The state will see it as a gift and make you Pay again if they assign child support - Read up on Title IV D, you'll see that child support is a federal reimbursement program. Read up on the Bradley Amendment - What you owe for Child Support can NEVER BE FORGIVEN, even in Death. They will seize your estate, your money, everything to get their TITLE IV D Money, denying your children an inheritance. Fight for your rights and your kids rights, do not give in to their scare tactics.

On average, I think females make better parents, but every parent is different. Please consider this scenario: Sometimes I don't control my anger, but only when someone makes me mad. Never physical. She plays ""cat and mouse"" when we have problems to discuss. She has not worked in eight years. She asks: what about the recent year+ trying a new profession? It wasn't even half of my salary. She is so lazy, she needs to hear it. She refuses to take responsibility, and always blames me. I hate when she walks away. A real woman would not walk away from her man when he needs to speak to her. She always wants to cuddle and more. I cannot be close to her when she is like that. I am fine on my own, and don't need a woman. She claimed to be trying to get back to work, but was using me. She said that when unemployment ran out, she would take any job. Even Illegals can land jobs, but she can't because she does not want to work. When she refused to apply for easy jobs, and insisted on her prior field, I said she needed to leave, or would force us to. I have had enough of her BS. She can live with family. I was smart enough to have her quit-claim the deeds to me a few months earlier, when she asked for a separation. She refused to leave, even after our children asked her to. She has used cannabis and even ketamine, and blamed me for her depression, claiming I have NPD. She forced the children and I to move out, because we can't live in the same house anymore. I filed a DVRO so she would have no contact. The judge said the allegations look like typical divorces, and ordered no assaults. She is violent, and even damaged our home once. She tried fixing it, but I can still see it. I encourage her to connect with our children, but she is asking for half! She promised me much more so I could take care of them, and they refuse any contact with her. She has made offers for us to move back until the divorce is final, but I refuse. She can't even pay the mortgage, but is still living there rent-free. She can work, she is just lazy. The children are behind me 100%! I need the money to pay for their college. Can you believe her?

divorce,10,10,Divorce consideration_and Brokerage vs. 529B ?,westst,2025/2/14 10:19,"reply to this post rate flag Divorce consideration_and Brokerage vs. 529B ? < westst > 2025-02-14 10:19 Hi all, so will try to keep this as brief as possible but there a few factors. I have 2 brokerage accounts based off money I inherited over the past few years, totaling about 660K. I manage one that’s about 390K. I have another that is separate brokerage (more on that in a bit…) for $270K that my father-in-law manages. He is also a CFP. In my 7 months of managing my own account, I have managed about a 16% gain. In his time over 3+ years, that account has 10% gains. Now he is about to join his 3rd company in 3 years which will entail me signing documents, transferring account funds (again) to a new company and their brokerage. (He is in his late 70’s and apparently has willingly or fallen out of favor with hist last 2 companies). The 2nd thing I am l looking at is my almost-teenager’ish kids college funds: which I have admittedly done a poor job funding. Each of them only has $10k each in their 529B’s at present. I am basically treating one of the brokerage accounts as their college fund, so I am trying to do my best to grow those. 3rd, I'm mentioning that there is a least the possibility that I would be seeking a divorce from my wife in the next 2 years. If not then, I can see it when the kids start college. So, with these factors in mind - I’m wondering if I should just cash out the 270K that would be following him to his next company and put it in the kids’ 529 funds? Are there tax implications to this? This whole thing is really about my kids and to a lesser extent being able to land on my feet somewhat financially if I seek a divorce. Both brokerage accounts are in my name at least, and I have it at least “on record” that they are solely funded by inheritance on my side. Whether that would help in divorce proceedings in a mainly 50/50 state, I do not know… But my thinking is this: If I keep that part in brokerage with my FIL, than my wife potentially gets half of the $270k in divorce. She could then try to “double dip” a bit, trying to get me to fund half of our kids’ tuitions when she has already gained half of the brokerage proceeds. I’m thinking – if it’s in my kids’ 529B’s, she would not be able to touch it – and of course that’s great for them. But it may creep along at 5-8% gains in the 529, while I could potentially grow it more in a brokerage account. (Of course would have to pay capital gains if funds are cashed out 5-7 years from now). I should state also that my FIL is a wealthy guy, and he could probably fund my kids’ college tuitions If we wanted to. He’s probably even mentioned doing so. But there is somewhat constant turmoil on that side of the family, so there is no guarantee that if my wife and I were to split up – that he would provide the half that my wife would have to pony up for college. There is a history of divorce on their side of the family, so I could see them trying to fight a little dirty. As to any question of why he manages my funds at all? Well like I said, he is a CFP, and 3 years ago offered to do it. I naively agreed to do so, reluctantly. I have now come to realize that I’m probably better at this than him after educating myself on investing, and he often seems a bit slow to adjust to sector/market trends. I would state that he is not a shady person and is professional, and I doubt he would try to screw me in any way. He’s generally been good to me and my kids. So, with all those factors in mind (brokerage/college fund/at least possible divorce)…I would be greatly appreciate folks’ thoughts when factoring in these 3 factors. I realize as well that I could also just insist on taking the $270K away that he manages and put it in my own brokerage account to manage. I think really that this would start WWIII in my family, and I am not prepared logistically to start a divorce yet, so I don’t really need any precipitants right now :- Thanks for your thoughts. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=333878522",0,TRUE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=333878522

Put the $270K in the 529B. Since your FIL is transitioning to a new job this makes it a great opportunity to cash out the $270 without raising red flags, and he hasn't been able to manage the funds as good as you think you could. As for the $660K I would just expect her to get half of it. It may not go that way but worst case scenario it gets split 50/50 even though it was inherited.

Alimony and child support are calculated based on legal guidelines, and your STBX cannot just divide the payments as he sees fit. Generally, the court looks at his total income and determines the amounts for alimony and child support separately, according to state guidelines. If he's adjusting payments without court approval, you should definitely consult an attorney or your local child support agency. They can calculate the proper amounts and help enforce what you're legally entitled to. You're right—having more children doesn’t reduce his responsibility to your two kids. Instead, his overall obligations might increase, but only through proper legal recalculation.

She told me many times before and after we married that before me, she never wanted to get married b/c no man could be good enough. Hindsight is 20/20, but until recently, I knew nothing about narcs. Years ago in therapy, when the therapist clearly stated her actions were abuse, she said she needed a strong man and could not be with me if I agreed! I said that the label didn't matter and we just need to keep her from getting that mad. The codependent was trying too hard 🙁 2 days ago, she said I needed to move out, or she would, with the kids. Having an unemployed spouse is too much. They are staying at her sister's tonight and did not bother to tell me. Many times in the past, I had agreed to her ""if we ever divorce, to make up for my lack of employment"" terms and we said we didn't need to waste money on lawyers. Recently I gave her quitclaim deeds to the property, with the understanding that I could stay until the kids graduate HS. I feel really bad for my kids. I need a lawyer! Thanks for listening! The Covert Passive Aggressive Narcissist: Finding Healing After Hidden Emotional and Psychological Abuse is the most comprehensive and helpful book on the topic of covert narcissism. This type of narcissism is one of the most damaging forms because the abuse is so hidden and so insidious. You can be in a relationship that can last for decades and not realize you are being psychologically and emotionally controlled, manipulated, and abused. These people are well liked, they are often the pillars of the community. Parents, spouses, bosses, and friends who are covert narcissists come across as the nicest people. They can be spiritual leaders, they are moms who bring over casseroles to needy people, they are the bosses that everyone loves and feels so lucky to work for. These relationships are incredibly confusing and damaging. They leave you questioning your own sanity and reality. Even though they are treating you terribly, you wonder if you are the problem, if you are the one to blame. You are filled with constant self-doubt when it comes to these people in your life. When you are around them you feel confused and muddled inside. You have a hard time seeing clearly. These relationships can bring you to a state of deep depression and complete depletion of energy https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=332809394",0,TRUE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=332809394

Conservatives in red states turn their attention to ending no-fault divorce laws After decades of no-fault divorce law, some conservatives want to make it harder to end marriages on the basis of irreconcilable differences. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Joanna Grossman of Southern Methodist University about the push-back. RASCOE: Well, what happened after no-fault divorce went into effect? GROSSMAN: What we saw was a decrease in female suicide. We saw a decrease in domestic abuse of wives. We saw a decrease in homicide of women by intimate partners. And we also saw generally, people feeling more able to control their lives - right? - that they were not stuck in unhappy marriages. So we did see an increase in the divorce rate initially, but since then, the divorce rate has pretty steadily declined.

I am NOT claiming that she cheated, but it was a large pile of things that added up to a life of low key torture for me. Let me also be clear that for 18 years she was an amazing woman and a beautiful person - inside and out. My mind still boggles at WTH happened. My best guess is the women at work started having a strong influence over her. I took a lot of heat for that decision, but it was worth it. Two years post divorce, I lost weight, started a new company, and had more women available to me than I could have ever imagined. Child support killed me financially, but what I made on the side with my business more than made up for it. I was happier, more attractive, healthier, and more upbeat than I had been for over two decades. Most importantly, I was free. Free from lies, secrets, and duplicity. When I came home, I felt like a good man. Literally every other person in my world thought highly of me; just not her. It felt good to come home from a long day at work and feel right about things. I smiled more and felt calmer and had more inner peace than I can ever remember having. On the other hand, she did the whole ""divorce party"" thing- went with her female friends to Vegas, dating apps, started smoking cigarettes (and weed I found out later), and drinking heavily. She started dating a guy, and that quickly came to an end. She tried to break up, but he got possessive. He was weak and pathetic in comparison to me. She even complimented me a few times, going so far as to say ""you look better than ever"" with a wistful look. True story. And yes, it felt as good as you would imagine it would. I would come over to pick up our children and say Hi and slap her ass. I knew she would have to hide that from her new man, because he was no match for me and he would likely want to confront me, and he would just get humiliated. Oddly, she seemed to like it and smiled when I did it. Go figure. But that's the sort of thing that made me divorce her to begin with - keeping secrets like that. Unfortunately, about two years post-divorce, she gained weight and sunk into deep depression. I will end the story there because it gets very sad from here. To this day I date women MUCH younger than me because women much younger than me are attracted to me. I was told differently and I didn't know reality. I do now. So men, as things are at their worst you will feel despondent and depressed. These feelings will not last forever. Just be sure to make weekly progress one small goal at a time. Don't compare yourself to others - just to yourself last year. Over the course of a year, you will be surprised at how far you can go. And keep in mind that without a woman (of a particular sort) to drag you down and hold you back, you can achieve so much more. Do this for your children. They will appreciate it. Mine do, and all of them have told me this more than once. My personal mantra is: ""The best revenge is a life well-lived"" I hope you'll make it yours too. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=331166407",0,TRUE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=331166407

I am contemplating divorce in a year or 2, unless the wife and I decide to co-exist for 7 more years until my 2nd gets to college. I recently inherited $400K from a relative who passed, and I am checking my thinking on how to invest/protect it in lieu of potential circumstances. I am thinking of doing this first for my 2 kids: - 15K for each of them in a HYSA I can get locally at 5%. -15K for each of them in their college accounts. (Catching up with their contributions as they both only have about 8,000 there right now) - Inclined to put $70K in a 6-mo CD at 5.25% – and I could roll it over. (Put the account in my name). So that leaves about $300K and I am pondering my options for this part. I'm thinking: 1) Invest most/all it in Index funds at Fidelity where I already have my 403b set up. I would just break it up amongst 4 or 5 funds, as I am generally aware of the best performers in the different categories/sectors. I also have a smaller brokerage account at Schwab - if I should keep the new money there instead of Fidelity where I have my 403B, but my wife and FA (who is also my Father in law), would be suspicious. Leading into my 2nd option: 2) Pay off rest of mortgage. I refinanced to a 3.25 rate five years ago. We have about $250K to go on a 30-year fixed. Equity in the house is about $350K with it being worth like 600K. So if I pay it off, in any potential divorce – one of the parties would have to buy the other one out. I’m thinking my wife might buy me out (and I would prefer to keep the kids primarily in home they grew up in), so maybe about 300K would come my way in a buyout in divorce, if I am calculative that correctly. I would plan on renting/buying locally so I could be close to my kids if we split parental rights. Could paying off the mortgage also be a good idea? That of course would suck up the bulk of the current inheritance. Some other figures if needed: I have 300k in my 403B, my wife will have a pension so she would be all set. We have minimal debt and about $30K in savings. Both make about 100K, me a bit more. I have another $270K in investments that my FIL has ""managed."" He has done a crap job and the account has only grown about 2% over 3 years - so he is not managing any of this new $$. I have another $200K in a stretch annuity. Both the current investment account and the stretch annuity are the result of inheritances from my Father’s estate – and I have it at least “on record” in note-to-files that they are funded solely by inheritance on my side. I am the Primary/only account holder on each…but I live in basically a 50/50 state. Although my wife should get some of it of course in a divorce, I think 50/50 is somewhat unfair - seeing that it all comes from my side and I am the primary account holder. I guess I would have a lawyer fight for this a bit - but I will ultimately be fair about it. So with all of these factors in mind, would appreciate your best assessment based on experience. Happy to answer any other ??'s. Thanks. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=331013898",0,TRUE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=331013898

Nor should any inherited funds be utilized to pay off your home, which would be considered marital property. To prevent any ambiguity about whether inherited funds are separate from marital funds (to guarantee that they cannot be targeted in a divorce), you might want to set up a trust and have the inheritance conveyed directly from the aunt's estate to the trust. In that case you would name yourself the sole trustee, the children as beneficiaries, and invest the funds as you have described.

Unless it goes into some type of account you opened before you got married that does not have your partner's name on it. And still then a good divorce attorney is going to argue it is marital assets.

I have had to pay more, daughter school expenses, purchasing grociees, or anything comes up I have to pay all the rest. I don’t understand women who take own all the financial responsibility with no help, if the other spouse is contributing with time, helping out with the house more responsibilities with the house and children, totally understand if one of the spouses take on more financial responsibilities, because they both are bringing something to the table. But how ever, my spouse would let me pay extra, would not help with any extra that comes up, rather car break down or our children need medical/ dental and it occurs a bill it’s on me. Am I crazy to ask my husband to contribute more Tito the house? What seems to be the amount now days for a household?

I’m a loner and have plenty acquaintances via work, wife, etc., but no one I feel comfortable with this subject. Married 28 years. Our one kid is grown and on their own for years now. I love my wife as a friend only. We have not been intimate for years, nor would I want to be with her. But I cannot go on without someone to love, with intimacy. Also, she presumes that she may decide major life issues for the both of us, and is very stubborn and bossy. That is not right for me. The issue is that I have some kind of fear or mental block about telling her that I want a divorce. I know her very well. When I tell her she may become suicidal, maybe homicidal, or evil in some other way. A woman scorned is something to fear. I absolutely will take care of her, give her everything, house, all the money in the bank, alimony. It’s all worth it to buy my life back. She has not worked for 30 years, and I have a high income. I just can’t seem to say the words “I love you, I will take care of you, BUT I want a divorce.” Someone said “Maybe you still love her and deep down you do not really want to break up.” No. I feel like a prisoner, with no control over my own life. If I can get over the hump of saying those words, to get the ball rolling, then I think I can handle it from there. (Barring any suicide or homicide or other extreme destructive behavior.) In a way, if she goes the route of anger, that makes it easier for me. The real problem I have is that I am over empathetic in general toward all people. I feel the pain of others. If she falls apart and says this is too much to handle and she can’t go on living, then I may crumble. That is not due to doubt in my mind. I cannot bear seeing others suffer. She knows that and will absolutely use it to manipulate me. I’m stuck, I’m miserable, and do not want to continue to live my life this way.

Those two things alone would bring millions of people to their side. Unfortunately they would also lose a chunk of their base. It's how politics works, sadly. BUUUUT... Since Democrats seem intent on violating the Constitution and our human rights (the 1st and 2nd Amendments for starters) I will vote for anyone who wants to ban abortion. In fact, I have become a single issue voter. Ban abortion or get F@cked. This has been the Democrat strategy for well over 5 decades now. And I see how effective it has been. One abortion is banned, then we can go after other issues and programs for women and minorities. In fact, I would gladly back a bill that restricts the right of Democrats to own firearms. I would also back a bill that limits minorities and women's right to free speech - since restricting ""hate"" speech is all the rage these days.

I have been married for 35 years and I want out. Just wondering if it’s possible for the wife not to get half of everything if I can prove. That financially she for lack of a better word abandoned all of her financial responsibilities. Some examples of this are she has maxed out her credit card to the tune of 15k and has made no attempt to pay it off for 20 years. When I confronted her she told me how dare I question her spending. She has never even worked a full time job. When my kids were about to start college I said you need to work full time to help pay for college. Her response was college tuition is all on you. I will not work full time. She has refused to contribute to the household expenses other than buying groceries and feels it is her right to have no limits on her spending and to never be questioned about.

Contemplating divorce, 2 pre-teen kids. Divorce would take place in state of MA. I make around $110K, wife makes around $100K. She’s a teacher so she’ll get a pension in about 15 years. I’m doing my best to play catch-up on my 401K. We have about $250K equity in our home. About $375K in investments. About half of that is in a stretch annuity where only I am named on the account. In the other investment of about 200K with a brokerage firm- we are both named as joint account holders. Funding for both investments are the result of paternal death in my family where I was one of the beneficiaries of inheritance along with my siblings. I at last have it on a “note-to-file”…filed with both firms that the investments are the result of inheritance from my side of the family. (I am not sure how much difference that makes in the scheme of things). She has not added anything financially (extra) beyond her joint salary to support our monthly expenses. With us having similar salaries, and hoping for 50/50 custody of children, would I necessarily get clobbered in terms of any spousal or child support? I am not sure if one of us would buy the other one out of the house…I am not even sure how that works as I would not have the “front” money initially to buy my wife out - to take sole ownership of the property. (It’s really of no consequence to me which one of us would take ownership of the home as I am not necessarily tied to it). But again my larger ? is if I am going to get clobbered in the divorce if our salaries are about the same. The consensus in this forum and otherwise seems to be that the guy tends to get screwed in divorce settlements – but I’m wondering if that would necessarily be the case in my situation.

So, I let him take the truck and keep it. Thankfully, I got to see some good karma not long after when he got into some big trouble when he was pulled over for a traffic violation.

There is legal and physical custody, sole and shared! Unless you two are going to live in the same town, or very close to each other, a judge isn't going to award you equal custody on both. A ""50/50"" custody as you refer assumes the kids spend equal amounts of time living at each home, and each of you will spend equal amounts of time parenting, and for school purposes they would have to qualify for the same district, or it can get messy. In most cases that is very rare unless you live across the street from each other. And in 99% of the cases in Mass they never see a judge until the separation agreement is finalized and you want the judge's final decree. So, if you two can work out an agreement and it appears to be equal time and responsibility you might be ok. To answer your question on support. Mass formula does take into account time, and without knowing factually what that looks like you would pay between $50 and $500 per week, and that doesn't take into account insurance costs! And if you have been married over 10-years there might be an alimony claim on her part, especially if she put part of her career on hold during the time the kids were young. I suggest you start with a good divorce mediation service and see if you can hammer out an agreement, if not it's time to lawyer up. Your inheritance might be protected from any claim by her, but most likely it will become at least part of any good negotiation talks from both sides. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=326904483",1,FALSE,3,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=326904483

divorce,60,60,Is divorce feasible based on my financials?,other8,2023/3/13 10:05,"reply to this post rate flag Is divorce feasible based on my financials? < other8 > 2023-03-13 10:05 Hello all, hoping you can weigh in about what I would be looking at financially, and if I can realistically still survive and work towards my retirement while providing for my children. I will lay out the facts and financials. I am M/52, my wife is 49. It was a marriage of (in)convenience – my Son was born out wedlock and I have regretted the marriage intermittently almost since the beginning. I am thankful for my 2 children (12 and 9), but after 11 years, it is just a tolerable marriage at best. I’m really so unhappy – and I would really like to make a fresh start while providing for my children. Here are the financials, sorry if I’m giving too much info; - Home worth about $525K, mortgage of $260K left. - Stretch annuity of $180K with Jackson Life Insurance. (I am sole account holder). - Investment account of $190K with Avantax (Joint account with my wife). **On these last 2, I made the rather short-sighted decision to make my Father-in-Law our financial adviser 2 years ago, so he is named as a contact at least on both accounts. He is a CPA, a pretty trustworthy individual, but my understanding is that I can make these “house accounts” to prevent any shenanigans that could possibly commence after announcing a divorce. NOTE: I was able to make these 2 investments after my late Father’s estate was settled after he passed 2 years ago. I have it at least on record as a NTF with both companies that the funding of these 2 accounts was based on deposits made as a result of my inheritance from my Father. - Vehicles worth $45K, all but $5k paid off. - Joint savings of $30K - I make $107K, my wife makes $95K (She will have a teacher’s pension in about 13 years, 80% of salary - My 401K: $165K, I hope to retire in about the same timeframe but I am catching up obviously. I live in Massachusetts which is known as an “equitable distribution” State…so not necessary 50/50 split, but maybe close to it. I understandably do not think my spouse is entitled to a 50/50 spilt in the investment accounts- even though one of the investment accounts is joint. I would be willing to giving her a bit more custody-wise on the kids, i.e. 60/40, 70/30 in lieu of the financial considerations. It has always been her “dream” to become a Mother and I would not try to take that away from her. I love my kids and want to provide for them in the best way, but the parenting has always meant just a bit more to her, so I would be open to giving her more custodial if that could be factored into the financials. Ideally I think we would want the kids to stay in our current home because they are settled into school, etc…but that would involve some sort of “buyout” on the house for one of the parties I would think. (And then christ, they have to go to college one day – very expensive up here). Average rent on a 2-BR in my area is about $2,500/month. I want to be close proximally located to my kids so I can still try to do the customary things during the week, i.e. pick my Daughter up at school, etc. Housing prices are so crazy right now in our area, I don’t think it would be realistic for me to own again in the short-term..so maybe a few years of renting. Since our salaries are comparable, I’m not sure how much child support I would have to pay – I know this goes up based on the custody split. I talked to a lawyer about 2 years ago and am obviously resuming this train of thought now. They are known as a fair firm that has good relationships in the courts and works well in my county. My wife might go for the more barracuda-type firm…I am not sure. She can be combative and she is the product of divorce so maybe they know how to fight dirtier. I just want what’s fair for everyone involved. I am just trying to figure out how I can survive without being buried financially. I suspect she’ll make out a bit better but that’s OK, as long as it’s close to an equitable split as possible. Any and all advice is welcome – on the financials and otherwise. Happy to answer any ??’s if needed. Really appreciate all the advice. Thanks. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=325980358",0,TRUE,3,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=325980358

It's not the only factor, but given how important your kids are to you, it's a significant one. Your kids don't know the whole picture, and I don't, either. Regardless, couples can make marriages of convenience work, as long as both are committed to staying loyal and converse as a couple. Does your wife want to make the marriage work, or does she want out? If the former, I'd try to be on the same page. It's not like ""love"" marriages don't come down crashing down far more often that they should - certainly more often than arranged marriages, for instance. So having minimal expectations can actually be a good thing, and something to work with. It's somewhere between possible and very iikely that your wife will be combative if divorce enters into the picture. I'm not about to make the decision of stay versus divorce for you, but ask yourself this: what is the real cause of your unhappiness? If you're letting one person define your happiness, that's something to work on character-wise. You can work on putting your happiness focus elsewhere while still in the relationship. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=325988943",1,FALSE,3,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=325988943

The numbers are going to get worse as the years go by and you will have less time to rebuild. You need to do your homework to find a good lawyer. Lawyers are like plumbers; some suck, some are out to drain you of every penny they can, some are actually fantastic. Start calling law offices, tell them you would like to find a lawyer for _advice_ on a divorce. Those that won't give you the time of the day unless you are paying, skip. Those whose first priority is to ascertain the size of the marital state (to figure out how much money they could expect to make), skip. Once you find a lawyer schedule a consult. Bring all your numbers and documentation and basically have him outline to you what to expect and how the process would march along. Make sure you take copious notes because right here you'll get your first clear picture of what should happen. In specific; you want to make sure that when you received your inheritance that you did not inadvertently destroyed the separation between personal and marital assets. Something as simple as receiving the funds on a joint account before moving it to your personal account would have tainted the money. Child support: it doesn't matter if the other parent makes money; child support is intended to support children not parents, so regardless of how much money the other parent makes the non custodian parent still pays child support.

But, to me the question is can you do it and protect the wealth for the entire family? So many people piss away their wealth in costly divorces and end up broke when they are done. The wealthier people are, the less they spend on lawyers for divorces, they know the value of money. So, in the end the easier it is done, the less expensive it becomes. In Mass about 99% of all divorces never go to trial, and the majority of them don't even have attorneys (beyond maybe a mediator). So, it ends up coming down to what is important to you. Based on 2 kids and those incomes, assuming the kids live 51%+ with their mom you would pay about $600 per week in child support. There are factors that could push it up or down, depending on things like insurance costs. And unless you are going to live in the same town, near each other, don't expect a 50/50 custody order. It just isn't realistic. And to me what really matters is what is most important to you? Freedom, money, kids, piece of mind, or that new girlfriend? Figure that out and the rest is pretty easy. Also, realize if your wife can't afford the home alone they will have to move, that puts added pressure on the children. Are you ready for that? If they are close to aging out maybe waiting until they are over 18-years old would help. And remember only assets accumulated during a marriage are considered marital property. So, if your retirement or 401K had half of its values before you got married you can protect some of that. And short-term marriages, under 5-years, have different rules.

I divorced in Boston in 1973, got every other weekend and 2 weeks in the summer and paid monthly child support, based on my income. I lived at college in NH and after she did not let me have my son for three consecutive visits, I went to his babysitter's and got him for the week-end. She charged me with kidnapping and crossing a state line with a minor, looking at 20 years if convicted. Fortunately the judge saw what she was doing and slapped her hand, told her don't do it again. WHEW! HERE's THE DEAL............. Go to the Circuit Court and ask for court ordered MEDIATION. Almost every state now has it, I know, I have been a Court Appointed Mediator in MD for over 20 years. You and your ex will meet with a mediator, who's focus is the best interest of the child, and discuss what you as parents want do about custody, visitation including holidays, child support, etc. It is not expensive and lawyers don't like it because they don't get to drag it out. YOU make the decisions, the mediator just asks questions and records it for the court and you sign a Memorandum of Agreement which is enforceable in court. You can always tweak it later according to your needs (life changes) without going to court, as long as you both agree. If you do not agree, it goes to the court an a judge decides for you. I have done hundreds of these cases and it is a win/win for all parties, including parents, children, your money (legal fees), time and hassle; plus of course, the court.

You may not be able to ""see"" the future (with so much change), to make a plan. Plans take shape with action; Start with one literal step and let the others fall into place, because they will!

You are fooling yourself with the fair split.

Heck a bad financial split now beats a good financial split 10 years from now, because of the lost time you could have used to rebuild your financial life. My split was 60/40 but because I got 'credit' for items at a ridiculous valuation she pretty much got 67% of the cash/retirement accounts. No alimony and the girls came with me. On the other hand it took me less than 5 years to recover my cash; I became very frugal and maxed out all my retirement contributions and savings. Five more years and an economic recovery between now and then and once again I'll have a solid chunk of change on my retirement and savings account.

She has made it difficult to see the kids (they live in another state) and every single phone conversation with her is a struggle that leads to an argument.

I've been married 32 years. 2 years ago I got hit by a car speeding in front of my home. Of course the driver didn't stop and of course the cops never found him/her. I got severely injured and still have not fully recovered. I thought I was the luckiest man alive. I TRULY loved, respected and ADORED my wife. I sang her praises always to anyone I could. I was so proud of her and our 3 children that we worked our whole marriage to get thru a good college. All 3 with STEM degrees . 1 of them has 2 BS and is working on a masters. As I said, I was so proud. I never missed a chance to tell her how much I loved her and how lucky I was. She would tell me often when I would tease her about leaving me that she never would do that. She wanted to grow old with me. (I guess we have already done that) And then the perfect storm, about 5-6 stressors hit us all at once. Flash forward, 2 years, she moved in with my daughter 1-1/2 years ago. She left bc she says I didn't talk to her for 4 days. I begged her not to leave and basically lost it afterwards. After 42 years of knowing something wasn't quite right with me and going to numerous psychiatrists and psychologists, 4 days AFTER she left they finally decided I might be bi-polar. I thought it was great that I finally knew why I was so moody. She says too bad, too late. Won't even consider counselling and the sweetest woman in the entire world has been nothing but a huge b to me. She does not even seem like the same person. 2 of the kids consider me dead to them and the third barely talks to me. I've fought with everything I have to save the family but she won't even consider counselling or her or the kids roles in any of this. It's like she must have been faking everything all those years bc she isn't anything like the same person. I'm actually becoming convinced her and 2 of the kids are narcissists I feel like I had no choice in any of it. Therapists says she turned our children against me. There's a lot more.

So far all I'm seeing is excuses to your behavior and blaming it all on her. Anything you mention you could have done wrong is expediently excused away. The fact that all your grown up 'kids' are pretty much unanimous on their take should give you a moment to pause; they are not children, they are adults and as you stated, pretty smart at that. But let's argue your take for a moment. Say she is a narcissistic psychopath. What is the absolute best thing that could happen to you? Well her faking it for 35 years, giving you a great relationship, and then leaving before her personality could no longer be contained. Somehow this possibility doesn't sound all that plausible unless you really want to believe that you are just a hurt victim in all of this. Memory has plasticity, meaning that even the greatest memories you have can be recalled later and turned into nightmares. My ex made me pretty miserable, but on the same breath I hope I never had to see her again as long as I live, I chose to cherish those moments we had when we were happy. Why? Because if you spend all your time demonizing your soon to be ex just so you can feel better now, you'll end up destroying the best years of your life, because that's what life is; our memories. Let it go, own your mistakes, and move forward. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=324544579",3,FALSE,3,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=324544579

I did do things wrong but I basically feel I had no choice and was pushed into the things I did. You're judging me with very little information. I admitted to you that I can sometimes be a little moody. I am also a very fair minded person and NEVER gaslighted her into thinking she did anything to cause me to become sad, UNLESS she did. Have I told you she lies a blue streak? She always has and it always hurts me because I DO NOT lie to her. There's so much you don't know. You don't know that she drinks like a fish now. A five liter box of wine a week and that's what she admits to. She says she needs it for a crutch. in the year and a half since she left she went from 130 to pushing 200 I'd say. She is self destructive. She won't listen to reason and fights about EVERYTHING. Most of the time it is nonsensical and outright ridiculous. She is the one that is refusing counselling and that should tell you something. Human behavior is so much more complicated than I can explain on here. It would take forever to explain everything. Rest assured, I know I am not perfect but I also know I am the only one that has made any effort at all to save our family. A therapist asked me why I even wanted her back knowing much more detail than you do. I do not lie to my therapist thinking that would be counter productive. I am there because I want to get better so telling me that I won't own my part is just not true. I wanted her back before because she and the kids were my life. They are my family and I knew if we were to divorce that it will harm the entire unit. I promised to stick it out with her thru thick and thin for that reason,. I believe that is how it is supposed to be. Of course when I am left with zero options I have to take the only road I can. I DID NOT WANT THIS and I truthfully don't even understand it. She said herself that she doesn't understand how we got here but refuses to even talk about it. BTW I said that I do not want the ""new"" her back. She is nothing but mean spirited and argumentative. In short she does not want to get along no matter what. She continually lies and refuses any form of cooperation. I only want her back if she could find the sweet loving, helpful partner she was.

You fully trusted her and while seeing the warning signs you probably thought that everything's okay and it will work out ""somehow"" and now you have it. You say there's enough for a book, if every middle aged man wrote about this kind of stuff, there won't be enough paper in the world for all the ""books"". Trust me, you are not unique, there are millions of men in the same situation, and your car accident has nothing to do with this, perfectly healthy men lose wives like this everyday. Basically what happened is that you lost value in her eyes as a man, she sees you as a weak person and most likely she is even mad at you thinking that you ""ruined"" her life by the fact that she chose you instead of spending her life with somebody else who in her eyes might be a stronger/better male character. To prove to you that you're weak, you begged your wife to stay, like a beggar on the street asking for change, this is very bad, by doing this you made things even worse. You should never trust a woman, she is not your friend. Truth to be told, she can be your best friend when she is young, but as women age they change and it's important to realize this fact as a critical thinker, and to keep them emotionally engaged, so that they don't lose interest in you. You are the captain of the ship that's called ""a relationship"", if you give away your leadership role, you end up on the island by the shipwreck in the middle of the ocean with nobody else beside you. Right now you have 2 options: 1. Sit at home all depressed, take pills, thinking you have some mental disorders, and slowly sink into the ground and degrade to the lowest levels of human existence. 2. Fix yourself up, you are a man, although you may not be used to acting like one for many years, but deep inside you nature has planted male characteristics that only unique to men. You have to wake them up and use them to your advantage. Find some hobbies, get a life besides work and truly, wholeheartedly forget about your wife. She will not return and she is in the past. Like the great times you had when you were 20 y.o. and full of energy. Do you cry that you will never be 20 again and get depressed? No, you realize it as a fact and adjust to reality. Now when you're older you find better things to do compared to when you were 20, and that's exactly what you have to do now in your current situation. With regards to kids, don't push them away if they truly want to make contact with you. If they find you as an annoyance, then don't chase them and leave them alone, but provide your contact info where you can be reached if they need something. Talk only to your kids, avoid talking to your wife, unless it's an emergency.

It's not as if you could have been taken completely by surprise by the end of your marriage, let's face it. All the talk about your great love, talktalktalk. Talk is not what keeps a marriage together, nor declarations of love or flattery. What did you DO? When the shit hit the fan, what did you DO? That's not to say she might not be a total narcissist. But in that case, what do you want her back for? And just because a person's had enough of your shit - that does not make them a narcissist.

From about 1997-2007 it was men who were overwhelmingly opting out, citing unreasonable standards placed on them by women, the fallout of personal stories of divorce, and a corrupt family court system. The narrative now has shifted to women: There are simply no good men available for dating and marriage. Especially in big cities. Policy makers have been scrambling in Japan for the past 20 years to stem this exodus, but it has only grown worse. This is a good development for men.

Then again, ANY criticism of ANY woman is viewed as misogyny in today's climate. Much like the words Nazi, Racist, and Fascist, these words no longer have any meaning. So there's that. But one thing to keep in mind - in Japan, China, and the US, it was MEN who stopped asking women to marry them. The rise in divorces is almost all women. And kudos to them for that. But the decline in marriage rates is all men. Either way, it makes things great for men like me. I have written at length about this before. Sex with no strings attached is one of a dozen major benefits of this cultural revolution. I just happen to know that it is not good for everyone the way it is for me. So I won't gloat like that.

Despite all the ""rules"" and ""safe guards"" I to try and keep in place for my wife from over doing it, here I sit alone while she is-let's call it what it is-passed out. She claims she's just laying down for a bit. Oh, and I really don't think you only had 3 glasses of wine, I'm 80% sure you put water in the bottle to give the illusion of only 3 glasses. Really? A 48 yo woman can't have 3 glasses w/o calling it a night at 7:00? Wait you had a tough day not going to work today b/c you.... ""need some time off""... Whatever the fuck that means. You quit your job over a month ago..... A graduate from UCLA, and two PHd parents. Upper class chick/woman/now drunk.... My wife is striking, tall, hot, sophisticated when she needs to be, funny, educated, a dynamo in bed, but a complete idiot, and a miserable drunk. To boot she battles depression, so the booze sets her back every weekend. She can't seem to pick up on the pattern after the past two years. So tomorrow morning I'll get to hear how I was the asshole, and literally, I mean LITERALLY all I wanted to do was sit out on our super nice porch, watch the sun set, sit by the fire, have a drink or two, listen to some of our favorite tunes, something we used to do most every weekend, but tonight I SIMPLY said how much I hated a song that come on Pandora, and she got up and left... Didn't tell me what or where she was going. So there I sit like a fucking tool by myself only to find her passed out in bed like 20 min later, claiming I ruined the night by me objecting to the music. At least we didn't fight as, be assured that would normally have led to a screaming knock down drag out, ruin the rest of the weekend situation. Always my fault. Just venting. Incredibly frustrated as this is now the new norm. So tomorrow I'll want to go for a hike, but she'll be too hungover... Rinse repeat next weekend.

You are contemplating divorce B. You are currently going through a divorce, or have already gotten one C. You are here out of morbid curiosity I will speak to those men in category A. You should be thinking a few things right now. ""How did I get here. What the F am I going to do now? What will happen with the kids? How can we afford this? My social life as I know it is over. Where is the woman I fell in love with? Why is everyone so nasty to me when there are two sides to this mess?"" I could go on, but you get the idea. This time in your life can be extremely depressing, stressful, and disorienting. It is a shock at many levels - physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and financially t name several. Almost every man who gets a divorce has to deal with these things, so although it may be cold comfort, it can help to know that tens of millions of other men know EXACTLY how you feel. If you spend any time on forums like this you will quickly understand why engagement is so low. Men typically do not waste time on sites with powerful gatekeepers. This place is not going to help you. Also keep in mind that there are MANY people who not only disagree with you, but they despise you for your genitalia - nothing more and nothing less. You will see them here all the time. They do not, of course, openly say such things. Hate speech is often thinly veiled. Any man over 30 here knows how this works. So if you DO decide to participate, remember that other men have been attacked here for sharing their pain or warnings to other men. Have heart and try not to let that bother you. If you are seeking understanding, support and information, find a competent counselor. These days, one must pay someone to listen non-judgmentally. And sometimes that is all one can hope for. If you are seeking information and community, you should check out various forums related to red pill content and M g T O w. People hate that there may be sites that attempt to help men, many are here in this very forum, but once you find a forum that helps, those sexists, racists and haters are generally banned so grown men can speak openly. Why anyone would not support this is beyond me, but here we are. Good luck to you. Be careful not to make any long-term decisions based on short-term feelings. Be sure to take care of yourself. Be aware that much of Western society hates you for being who you are. Be sure to get in shape, focus on improving yourself, and learning from other men who have been where you are. The world is much better in many ways than it was just 20 years ago. Take advantage of that and grow and develop. Many men send their best wishes to you. We have your back such that we can offer assistance. Find us. We are out there waiting. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=324022730",0,TRUE,4,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=324022730

My daughter loves her new baby sister, my wife and I are ecstatic and my old wife even dropped off my daughter this week whereas I usually meet her at a middle ground of Home Depot to do exchanges. HERE is my issue: our marriage was obviously a mess for a long time, we lived with her very abusive family because she refused to move out of the house to start a life with me, but she had told me while dating that she wanted to start a life with me and have a baby and she loved me. She said that same thing to the guy she cheated on me with for 2 years before we actually split. She lied to me and her daughter and everyone around us and when I discovered the truth during our divorce(not even having papers finished) I told absolutely everyone she knew or I knew or knew the two of us because I refuse to keep that shit to myself. it is 3 years since we split and she is still with the guy she left me for, and drives his car to drop off/pickup and I can't help but get upset. not RAGEFUL mad but upset. I thought this trigger would go away eventually and I just can't shake it. I don't trust her or the guy she left me for or any of her family or any of her friends that accepted her actions without even saying that it was wrong what she did to me. To make it more clear, she was basically non-existent in my child or my life even though we lived together with her family and slept in the same bed obviously far apart. I went through her grandmother's dementia coming and trying to get into our room, her father had a crackhead living with us that stole or broke my tools that I needed to do my job as an electrician. I did YEARS worth of maintenance to the house and lot turning it from receiving eviction notices to being up in value and replaced every fixture and appliance in the whole house from their deteriorated condition to useable. I made the yard safe for my daughter to play in and made a space in the garage to create art and supported her through becoming a manager at her company and took on the heavy lifting of raising our daughter during all the chaos. I guess here is the main point: I don't ever want them to be part of my life, I don't ever want to see that piece of shit around my daughter and I will not wish them well in the same way that she wishes us well, and I shouldn't have to right? She has treated my daughter unfairly and my daughter knows it and tells me so. I just am so conflicted, my wife tells me to put it behind me and be okay but I have no desire to and she has never apologised to me or acknowledged what she did was wrong and has not changed her behaviour she still lies and deceives my daughter and hides what she does from everyone. AM I WRONG? What do I do from here? or is it okay that I don't want to? it doesn't matter in my life as far as I know, my daughter loves me my wife and baby love me and I am a comensurate good person and not even my ex in laws dislike me but I just refuse to have any kind of relationship with any of them UGH https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=323101752",0,TRUE,4,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=323101752

divorce,46,46,Love...But Just Cannot Be Married,lgldsr73,2022/8/7 14:34,"reply to this post rate flag Love...But Just Cannot Be Married < lgldsr73 > 2022-08-07 14:34 My Wife and I met in 2001 and were married in 2003 for 10 years. Very much in love we had it all: outstanding (understatement) sex life, did everything together, really loved each others company. Around the eight year mark things began to fall apart and by the end of the 10th year were divorced. I moved out and three months later we reconnected and things were great. However, I had prior to that decided to move out of State, plans were in place, much of my belongings were already shipped and I was going. I thought we needed the time apart. Now out of State, I'd fly back once a month and then nine months later she flew out and I decided to pack up and head back with her. Four years went by and we remarried, and that lasted for six years. AGAIN we were divorced. AGAIN I moved out of State. So here I am out of State as I write this and we spend two hours on the phone each night talking. It doesn't take a Rocket Scientist to realize that we're still very much enamored with each other. There's been some talk about me moving back but with that said we will NOT be getting married under any circumstances whatsoever and will live in separate residences. I'm still very much in love with her and we're working out the logistics to see how we can some time to see how are mutual feelings are. I'm sick of this moving back and forth. Things are different this time on her end however. She is seeing someone and has been for some six months or so. They are fond of each other but 'love' has not entered into the picture. Sex however has and in a big (pardon the pun) way. She is petite and very good looking. I know two Women who have dated him and their legs get weak and you think they're going to pass out. I asked her about this, she's never lied to me and was quite graphic. I should state that there is not now nor has ever been a jealous bone in my body. I have been with 36 Women in my life and can separate love and sex in a heartbeat. What she told me is in line with what my two female friends said: ten inches, thick, easily lasts one hour (as in sixty minutes) and ready to go after a ten minute break, and in her case they went four times in five hours during one evening. I did bounce that off of my two female friends (I.e., four times in five hours, etc) and they said ""Oh yeah, that's him!"" with one adding ""Did she bring a rain coat, because it just never stops!"" referencing the sheer amount of cum that shoots all over each time. With the above as a given I've got my hands full here. He obviously satisfies her sexually that neither I nor the other Men she's been with were able to, and we had a dynamite sex life. However, she knows as I do that you cannot build a relationship around that as eventually it will become the norm and lose it's uniqueness. I did tell her that if she does connect with me she's welcome to have as a FWB. She does not how well that would go over with him. Whatever. He makes six figures but she cannot and will not be motivated or owned by money. She has her pride and I commend her for that. She had to have some car repairs done, we both offered to pickup the tab unbeknownst to each other and she turned us both down. She needed a new cell phone and again, told us in no uncertain terms ""Thanks but no thanks"". I guess the overall big picture here is you have two people that love each other (she and I) suffice to say that I am still in-love with her but we just can not be married to each other. It does not work. Anyone hear of this before? Know of anyone else that has been there? I'll be flying out there shortly to try and win that heart over but I've some heavy obstacles to get past...namely that Telephone Pole, LOL. She's wild about that, notwithstanding she does know as I said that you can't build a relationship on sex. Tried that, does not work. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=323086477",0,TRUE,4,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=323086477

She CAN, however be motivated by a big dick. So what were you shooting for with this comment. > She has her pride and I commend her for that.

And being engaged in the relationship - starting with regular conversation - helps a lot in terms of intimacy. That's undeniable.

Now what? < GitErDone > 2022-03-28 14:00 My lovely wife had a husband who was terrible with money. Always spending more than they had, always making bad financial decisions. Despite my best efforts to turn that example around, my adult stepkids are all not great with their finances. Stepson went and bought a very expensive car and lost it when he couldnt make payments. Stepdaughter 1 has overleveraged on a house they are struggling to pay in a downturned job market. And the kicker is stepdaughter 2. She WON $120,000 in a lottery last year. We thought she was set for at least 10 years since she has been the most careful of the three with her money. Nope. One year later and she's broke. She didnt work for a whole year, and either donated, or spent all but 7k she used to buy a vehicle. Incredible! Now she's just barely starting to work again and is very worried she wont make rent in 5 days. My wife has offered to give her rent money if she cant make enough. I am livid. I DO believe in bailing out your kids *in an emergency*. Sitting on your butt for a year and blowing 120,000 is NOT an emergency and I have stated very strongly that we are NOT giving her a penny for rent. Its not like she didnt know it was due. She can get a side gig, she can get a payday loan, she can borrow it from her brother or sister who she lent $5000 to, she can pawn her car - but she's 30 years old and Im adamant that we DONT bail out a 30 yr old who has no financial wisdom. The one mitigating factor is that shes extremely fragile emotionally and being this stressed is going to put her into a depression or worse. I get that. But I also see where bailing her out after this kind of terrible decision making is going to only make it easier to keep doing it. Her life is not going to get better if we enable her.

Ultimately, you can explain your point of view do your wife, which you've already done to some degree. However, if you can't agree on the wisdom of offering rent money, this stepdaughter and the others will know to bypass you and only talk with mom. Which, by the way, a lot of kids do anyhow: they don't care about the options of non bio parents, especially when they take the harder line. Does your wife feel the decisions made were terrible, or simply unfortunate? Lottery winners have a history of making bad decisions partly due to a change in lifestyle, but society as a whole tends to only financially plan for the short term, not the long term. Not seeing the long term picture may simply be viewed by your wife as unfortunate, in which case you'd either want to explain your source of disagreement. There's better options that giving money to a bad spender, but suggesting asking a family member for a loan isn't one of them. You don't want to compound the issues by creating family tensions from a sibling who doesn't pay back money. And one thing: your wife's account of her previous marriage is simply second-hand information to you.

I have several friends that complain of the same thing. They meet a woman. The relationship is everything that they has always wanted. Both sides are giving and the sexual relationship is just what they wanted. Then they get married. The wife now talks about how the man puts too much importance on sex. The man has to beg for it, and at times feels like he has been the object of a chore, as he seems to be the last priority of her day, week, or month. In my situation, I do all of the cooking, I help clean and do laundry, so it isn't like I am asking her to do everything, while I just go to work and watch TV. I have been told that she will not tolerate cheating. Of course, I wouldn't do that, as my last relationship ended with my wife cheating on me. However ladies, how do you expect to keep a husband or a partner if you minimize his needs, and expect him to do without. Or in some cases, you make him feel like he is not worth the intimate time together. While I realize that we all have different libidos, there has to be some compromise. Thoughts?

Lots of men and women making personal attacks on one another - women are the majority of these from what I see. I put up with enough emasculating behavior from my ex as many of you here have also experienced. Why come here and be subjected to the same kind of vindictive personal attacks? Personally, I am avoiding divorce going forward - been there, done that. Got rid of the ex, built a business from scratch, am now a millionaire for the first time in my life and I don't have a wife undermining my accomplishments. The answer to avoiding divorce is never, ever get married or get a woman pregnant - I just stay away from them because all they want is to use me, my labor, money to benefit themselves instead of earning it themselves. Like vultures they circle around looking for a free meal and when a man is stupid enough to agree to marriage they pick his bones clean and then of course move onto the next willing idiot with resources they want to get their hands on. Don't let em in... avoid as much contact with them as possible and the ones that say ""Gee I'm sorry you've run into women like that... I'm not like that and a lot of women I know aren't either""... those are the ones I watch out for most. Wolves in sheep's clothing who are pretending to be out looking for love but are in reality camouflaged predators on the hunt. Now I know it's fun to lead the wolves on and play with them, lie to them, hit it and quit it, but doing so isn't helping you ""get even"" guys and acting that way makes you no better than them in some ways. Simply smile, be polite and walk away and don't say anything Karen can use against you in a court of law. Oh and if you decide to get married, I'll be there to say ""I told you so."" https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=320630738",0,TRUE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=320630738

She initiated the divorce, not me and our children were young. I did not cheat, was a good husband, kind/careing and father and provider. When she announced she wanted a divorce she did so to me and our 3 young children - I was in shock as I never saw it coming and our children started screaming and crying. Staring at her in disbelief in that moment I noticed she she was stone-faced and seemed immune to the cries of our children and the short and long term ramification of ""her announcement."" She was cold/hard when she was once warm, soft and loving. She followed through with her attorney and played every dirty trick in the book... falsely alleging verbal/physical abuse and doing her best to get 100% custody of our children through any means necessary. After 25 years of dating and marriage I met a woman I never knew existed... angry, ruthless, a pathological liar and greedy we cannot forget how taking all the money and assets she could was a primary driving force. Last but not least, she sat there in court crying and playing the victim whilst concurrently demonizing me in any way she could imagine. With the help of the family law system all I had worked for and built with my family, children, professional career, etc., was destroyed and in the end my health was the primary casualty of it all - and still is. Since that time I've helped many friends, family and acquaintances through divorces and although I thought my story was unique it was and is not unique for the large part. When a wife makes up her mind to divorce her husband it's like a light switch is flipped and suddenly you find out who you thought you were married to is replaced by some kind of greedy, malevolent, lying sadistic sociopath. Honestly I think it's in womens' nature helped along by a legal system that reward that kind of behavior. How do I know this? My ex-wife lied repeatedly on the stand under oath and when I questioned my attorney about it he said the judge and court don't do anything about it so it's not worth pursuing. Lying is allowed in court - by women, not men. Playing the victim is also womens' domain. The money/assets/custody of the children flows in one direction - away from men to their wife first in the legal proceedings and later in the form of alimony and child support. I only got married once and divorced once. I am a one-trial learner. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=320321791",0,TRUE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=320321791

I've tried bars, friends, online dating, social media, etc. It used to be that women dated within their surrounding community so their choices were limited. With the invention of online dating statistics show that things have changed and women are dating the top 15-20% of men and ignoring the bottom 80-85% - why? Because they can. More women than ever have college degrees and they refuse to date men who are less educated and make less money than they do - it's call hyper-gamy. Women are always looking to trade up - to land a man who is better looking, more athletic, has more money, a big house in a nice neighborhood, etc. When you date she is not yours, it's just your turn until she finds someone better. You said past women have said they will call you back but never do and just ghost you - it's because they found someone better (and they will ghost that someone when they find someone better). You said ""I wonder why women are not attracted to honest, hard-working and down to earth males that are straight forward""... comon, guys like that are boring, women want the big, strong, dangerous men who make their lives exciting. You act like women make reasoned logical decisions when in fact they do what feels good and use men to get what they want at any given point in time. Of course the rise of feminism and movies portraying women as just as strong/capable as men has confused some men and women out there about how male/female relationships work. When I got divorced my ex took my kids, my health, my money, my assets and lied about me on the witness stand under oath. I found out after talking to many other men that sort of behavior is the norm, not the exception. I dated for a few years after my divorce but it was always the same in the end... using me for emotional support, to fix up their house, vehicle, for financial support, take them traveling and basically pay for everything. I got tired of being used and manipulated so I quit letting my penis lead me around, stopped dating women and focused on starting a business of my own on top of my full-time job. It took about 10 years but I went from dead broke to becoming a millionaire. I should emphasize this was the first time in my life I was a millionaire - why? Because I focused all my free time and energy into building up my business. The richer I became and the more I scaled up my business the more women became interested in me - imagine that. After considering the way women operate I chose to employ the same criteria they impose on me. Are they attractive, do they have a big house, make a lot of money, etc. - fair is fair right? I had a date with one at a restaurant who started questioning me about my finances and actually wanted to know how much money I made. I told her the question simply wasn't appropriate. She then said she wouldn't date a man who made less money than her. I said, ""so what do you want to do, compare checking account balances?""... as a joke. I was surprised that she immediately jumped on that suggestion and pulled up her online account proudly displaying her $6500 balance in my face. I asked her if she was sure she wanted to see mine and she was quite eager so I showed it to her and instead of being pleased at my 150k plus balance she jumped up and stormed out of the restaurant leaving me to pay the bill. She didn't come to date me, she was there to make it a contest with me over money. Who won and who lost? We both lost and as it stands, that's the way it is in the current environment. So what are your choices? Become an alpha dog? Make a pile of money? Become a ""bad boy"" so women will like you better? Give up on women? Hold women to the same dating criteria they hold you to in terms of looks, money, big house, etc.? Divorce taught me at the drop of a hat I can lose my wife, kids, assets, money, savings, self-respect, etc. Why did my wife initiate divorce? Her father promised her a pile of inheritance money if she followed his leadership instead of her own heart, mind and put being a wife/mother at the top of the priority list - i.e., she found another man with more money and left me for him... didn't matter it was her own father. After I became a millionaire she wanted me back... imagine that... never going to happen. She never remarried, she currently lives with her aging father and I assume they will live happily ever after together. Sounds like to me you want a woman to love you for who you are on the inside, not for what you can give her in terms of materialism - financial security, big house, bad boy excitement/variety in live and in the bedroom. Women are like children whose desire to be perpetually entertained and it's up to you to keep it excited and keep the focus on her narcissistic proclivities... it's all about her, not you. As yourself do you wish to associate with someone who has the same mindset as a Capuchin Monkey? This is genuine research, feel free to look it up: You may have thought things like currency or money are concepts known solely to humans. While it’s true some animals might have a sense of ownership, trading resources and the likes haven’t been observed in any other species besides Homo sapiens. However, in 2005, an economist/psychologist duo from Yale University managed to teach seven capuchin monkeys how to use money. The study went into some unexpected territory not long after. Monkey Business Gotta pay the rent tomorrow on the cage. Still a few monkey dollars short. “Gotta pay the rent tomorrow on the cage. Still a few monkey dollars short.” “The capuchin has a small brain, and it’s pretty much focused on food and sex,” said Keith Chen, a Yale economist who along with Laurie Santos, a psychologist, are the two researchers who have had made the study. ”You should really think of a capuchin as a bottomless stomach of want,” Chen says. ”You can feed them marshmallows all day, they’ll throw up and then come back for more.” https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=319999648",1,FALSE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=319999648

But I will say that not all ladies are looking for the next better thing. There are ladies out there that DO want what's underneath and truly care about who they want to be with. It's not about wanting the ""bad boy"", or the ""alpha dog"" for every single lady out there and you can't speak for all of his because 1. You aren't a lady and 2. Unless you've dated and I mean dated every. Single. Lady... you can't claim to know what we truly want. And parts of online dating are a joke. People that are on there are the only looking for physical attraction and what they think is a connection, face it. Online dating is just for a quick quickie. It's sad how the digital age has dampened down how couples meet and it's crap like that that gives not just ladies, but men a bad rap when choosing for the opposite sex. And just saying but men can and will do the same thing. Date a lady till they better up. You act like MEN make reasoned logical decisions. So if that's true tell me something... what's the logical reason for my husband having cheated on me, when I put him up on a pedestal so damn high, gave him everything he ever asked for. Cooked, cleaned, took care of our blended family AND worked myself. And his ""reasoned logic"" was because rhe kids made him do it. So why did I have to be the one to suffer?! There is no winner in this. Men and ladies alike are just the same. You can't blame just one sex and claim only one is searching for a better up. There are ladies out there like me, who don't want the dangerous bad boy next door. Don't want the alpha male that handles everything and makes us ladies feel like we have to depend on them for everything. There are ladies like me that want a partnership, cuddles, kept promises, truth... and there are ladies like me that want boring in their own right types of guys. And just in case this might cross your thoughts, looks are more attractive if the right personality is there. I'm not going to say I don't have.... ""standards"".

I was confused about that at the time, but now I think I understand what she meant. Both of my previous marriages ended in divorce because they both screwed around on me. I was in the military working odd shift-work schedules and going to college trying to better myself for us. I suppose they had too much free time on their hands because I was always so busy (but not neglectful of them at all). I can forgive that, but I don't have to live like that - with an unfaithful woman because some guy had a good pick-up line and I guess maybe they both thought they wouldn't get caught. Wrong. Neither of them was smart enough to not get caught. I think women feel empowered to be in control of their own lives - and that's a good thing, but where it goes south is when they cross the boundry and try to control mine (or yours). I think lots of women are trying to control a man and that's a huge part of the problem these days - they don't seem to understand that every relationship is going to involve compromise from each person and they can't do it because their manipulative personality and need for control gets in the way. Save yourself the headache and move on (quickly) from those types of women.

I have been married for 11 years and have two beautiful girls ages 6 and 10. I used to lived and work abroad in China for 12 at first for big company and really enjoyed working abroad. After a while I became disillusioned with the corporate life and became an entrepreneur and started a couple different businesses. It was there I met my current wife. We returned to the U.S. where we married and had children. After years of marriage, I am now growing more and more dissatisfied with our relationship and not sure what to do. I don't want to put my information on any singles site because I have a business in the local area and prefer to maintain my privacy. I have been faithful all these years and have provided well as the main bread winner and I assume she has been faithful as well, as far as I know. The problem is that she does not care for our children well, she does not help maintain our home in anyway, and recklessly spends my money and her own. From the beginning she was not extremely sexual or a very intimate person. In the beginning I thought because I used to be extremely sexual and had my fair share of girlfriends while living abroad, I thought it was a trade off I could live with in order to be married and start a family. My wife is extremely intelligent with an extremely high IQ and maintains a prestigious job however she does not do well with the simple things in life like maintaining our house, caring for the children I am find myself having to do everything. ex. cleaning the house, doing the laundry, yard work, trying to save, doing the dishes, holiday things like setting up the Xmas tree, wrapping gifts and basically everything except for cooking (she rarely does dishes and when she does it is still a mess around the sink. I have told her many times we need an Au Pair to help care for the kids so we have more time to do other things but she is too lazy to finish the only application. I am wanting more out of our relationship and would like to see if there are any woman out there that I would be a better fit. What I am looking for is a pretty woman that could first be my friend and then my lover. I don't need a woman with a prestigious job or high IQ, I want a woman that enjoys intimacy and is also able to be my partner that is willing to work with me to build a bright future. Someone that is not lazy or afraid to do a little work around the house and knows how to organize things. I cannot divorce my current wife until then because it will make matters worse for me and the children. I am pretty fit and pretty easy on the eyes and prefer the same if possible.

Quickly you will be able to divide them into two camps; those with a forced smile (if at all) that look like they carry the weight of the world on their shoulders, and those with a bright open smile that makes it easy to imagine it being the same smile they had when they were teenagers. Now for the hard part of the exercise. Take a few selfies of yourself and on a spectrum of 1 to 10, one being a suffering soul in purgatory, and ten a beaming smile that lights up a room, tell me where you rank yourself. Honestly a frank honest smile makes anybody attractive. What you want to do is to learn to unencumber yourself of a lifetime of weight until you move up that spectrum.

You'd go a long way toward moderating the worrying if you can remove the ""too late"" part from your mindset. Not just in terms of relationships -- in a much broader sense than that. It's true that we don't get any younger. Many us in the late middle-age wonder if their health will give out on them in one way or another. And that's a legitimate cause for concern, if not worry. Which makes it all the more important to 1) use the wisdom you've built up over the years to have an even healthier lifestyle and 2)do things you've wanted to do all your life that you realize it's never ""too late"" to do. The second area of focus can be just as positive a development for you as the first. It doesn't have to be major, it can be just local places in your area that you haven't seen for ages, if at all. The process of rediscovery doesn't have to cost anything. It may help you feel and think younger, but that's not even the point - the point is to realize that aging doesn't need to stop you from being a fun person. And you can be a fun person without a lot of money and with a busy schedule. There's a huge upside: it's a refreshing change from someone with ample money and expensive tastes. Many men have been there, done that as far as dating and don't want to go that route again. And right now you'll find that more and more single people are working 50-75 hours a week but still want a dating partner. But only someone who's genuinely a fun person. That's something to work on, independent of anyone else. It will help you deal with life's struggles on a day to day basis, regardless of your relationship future. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=318725322",3,FALSE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=318725322

Your sex drive comes from how you feel and how your partner makes you feel. An experienced man will make you feel desired, which in turn can (in most cases) increase your desire to be satisfied sexually. It is a new world that you will find yourself in when thet happens. Your life will feel fulfilled and you will have a completely different outlook. Anyway, I hope that you cross paths with the guy that can do this for you.

I was obviously able to recover both my composure and the vehicle when I pulled the car over just outside of shot mountain. I exited the vehicle moving as fast as I could to the passenger door which I opened with designs intended to rectify that particular situation quick fast and in a hurry. Then I looked at my brides big brown German-Apache eyes and thought to myself how did such a big gal fit in my little car thats when I closed the door walked back to the drivers seat and asked if she was hungry. The moral of the story is had I retaliated in kind our life together would never be the same ever again. I loved her more than I did those few teeth it's not like they were important teeth way in the back where nobody could see them. The ending to that story is a sad one I wasn't able to get over that particular happenstance I ended up trying kill that woman well I didnt she was too mean for me so I hired some fellas to rattle her cage and after she kicked their asses we started to get along fine many years later I understood that hillbilly truck drivers words he was warning me.

I went on the dating app Bumble and am talking to several women. So far i had two dates. One was ok the other not so good. I did connect with a girl i am very attracted to but she is a doctor and seems to have a very busy lifestyle. however she has been very receptive to me and suggested meeting up. Its challenging cause we live 45 min away and its hard for me to go out during the week and she is busy all weekend. I could easily see myself falling for her however after just getting out of a marriage i am enjoying my freedom and am hesitant to get involved with anyone seriously now anyway. The biggest issue i am facing now is that i really want sex - my former wife and i had no intimacy for several years (it was a very bizarre relationship we had) and I am now 46 and have been deprived for so long. but with covid its very risky to get close to people now even vaccinated. im in a very tough spot. part of me just wants to not date and delete the app and focus on my health but if i had a good connection with someone and had physical intimacy i believe it would help me heal. appreciate any suggestions https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=318193882,0,TRUE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=318193882

Ive been with My wife for 11 years and married for 6 of those years. 7 months ago she moved out. We have two amazing daughters. I love my wife more than i know how to express. Ive made plenty of mistakes over time ( not cheating) and even tho she cheated while we were engaged, we moved forward and married and started a family. Months before she moved out she stopped telling me she loved me or responded with i love you two. Then she moved out. And the last 7 months has been hell for me. Yes we still hang out, go out, do stuff with the kids together, even still have sex with each other on occasion. She’s currently living with her sister. My mind has been driving me crazy. There are times I’m in so much pain i feel like saving her the pain and just ending it myself. And i talk myself into tell her its over when she comes over but then she comes thru the door and my heart leaps with joy she’s here. And i cant say the words that’s its over. I literally hate myself for every mistake i made. I would give my life to take away her pain. My love for her has been and always will be unconditional. But seems her love for me is not. But then at times i feel things will be better cause if she didnt love me then why would she cry, why would she still be here, why would she not have filed papers yet? I would do and or sacrifice anything about me for her. I think about her all day and night and lose sleep thinking of her and i go crazy wondering what she’s doing. I get lonely and jealous and make things worse. I dont know what to do. I wish i could take all her pain away and take it on for my SA elf so she could be happy. I really dont know how much longer i can go. I feel like I’m running on fumes. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=318130107",0,TRUE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=318130107

As I read through your trials and tribulations I couldn't help but be sympathetic with that said sit down and get something to write with. You must have both children tested for paternity just because you started this relationship off stupidly don't mean you have to end it the same way. Get yourself tested for STD's ASAP then get the best ambulance chaser you can afford you must get full custody or the whore of a wife will make whores out of your female children again presuming they are in fact yours. I know this sounds harsh but apparently you may have needed this before you jumped in the matrimonial arena with a woman who treats her vagina like a clown car. The time for nice is over stop beating yourself up we all make mistakes not quite to this degree but nevertheless it's time to man up. Dwell on the future of your offspring remember one parent is a whore don't let the other be a love sick loser or they too will likely be victims down the road. Get those yourself and the kids in some form of counseling ASAP you all can and will benefit. Do not let yourself get caught up in the emotional BS you have a duty to provide and protect your children first and foremost woulda, shoulda, coulda is past tense like the whore you married. This kind of thing happens far too often you're not the first and will not be the last guy to marry a whore. Do not let this happen to you again perform your due diligence before entering into a committed relationship set some standards if you have the slightest reservation revisit your situation air on the side of caution behave like your happiness depends on making the right choice. Lastly, we always get the love we think we deserve raise your expectations seek guidance from loved ones and remember Jesus loves you he will never let you down and is always available to share your burden... https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=318279782",1,FALSE,5,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=318279782

No more sex, no more acting like friends, no more she gets what she wants BS. She doesn't respect you because you are a wuss. A servant, nothing more. Time to get your shit together. 1. Get your ass to the gym. This will help you in many ways. Emotionally, physically, and build confidence in yourself. 2. Cut her out of your life. You can't be available 24/7 or even ever. Just be busy at all times. Even when you aren't busy, tell her you are. 3. Change the bedroom. This is huge. Make it YOUR room. Manly furnishing, drapes, sheets, etc. Move her stuff to storage in the garage or basement or an empty room. She moved out. This is now YOUR room. Same with the bathroom. 4. Get some new clothes and cologne. You are reinventing yourself from the wuss you have been and building the best YOU you can be. 5. Make a schedule when she can come over. No unannounced visits. She moved out. This is your house, not hers. She is a visitor and has to work around your schedule. Remember you are busy a lot not, even if you are not. She wants to be free then make it happen for her. This is a consequence of moving out. This will help a lot.
