At first glance, our growth forecast of 1.9% for 2025 on an annual average basis suggests little change in conditions from our November update. However, on a fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter basis, we have shaved real GDP growth by approximately 40 basis points amid weaker spending by households and governments (federal as well as state and local). We now forecast the economy will only be 1.55% larger by year-end 2025 versus year-end 2024. This is a sizeable deceleration from the 3.2% and 2.5% expansion seen in 2023 and 2024, respectively. https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/250325-economic-outlook-u-s-q2-2025-losing-steam-amid-shifting-policies-13450076 https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334633596",0,TRUE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334633596

He did not go to New York to consult with Wall Street. He did not go to Dover, Delaware, to receive the bodies of four American servicemen, killed in an accident while serving in Lithuania. Instead, he went to Florida, where he visited his Doral golf resort, which was hosting the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament, and stayed at his Mar-a-Lago club, where many tournament fans and sponsors were staying too. His private businesses took precedence over the business of the nation. Many of his guests were also interested in boosting Trump’s personal interests, as well as gaining the American president’s favor. One of them was Yasir al-Rumayyan, who runs the $925 billion Saudi sovereign-wealth fund and is also the chair of the LIV tournament. Other sponsors of the tournament included Riyadh Air, a Saudi airline; Aramco, the Saudi state oil company; and, startlingly, TikTok, the Chinese-owned social-media platform whose fate Trump will personally be deciding, even as he profits from its sponsorship and support. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334633559",0,TRUE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334633559

Are you prepared to sign off on the Oracle and TikTok deal, even though the Treasury isn’t getting paid? And also, does the deal meet your requirements in terms of national security concerns? THE PRESIDENT: Okay, they’re giving me studies on the deal. It has to be 100 percent as far as national security is concerned. And, no, I’m not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal. We need security, especially after what we’ve seen with respect to China and what’s going on. We want security. So I’ll let you know.

In other words, I said, “No, I want a big chunk of that money to go to the United States government because we made it possible. And the lawyers come back to me and they say, “Well, there’s no way of doing that.” You know why? Because nobody has ever heard of that before. Nobody has ever said that before. Nobody has ever said, “Well, we’ll approve the deal, but we want a lot of money to go to the government because by approving the deal, we’re making the deal valuable.” They’ve never heard of that before.

Negative growth is a contraction in business sales or earnings. It is also used to refer to a contraction in a country's economy, which is reflected in a decrease in its gross domestic product (GDP) during any quarter of a given year. Negative growth is typically expressed as a negative percentage rate. KEY TAKEAWAYS Negative growth is a decline in a company's sales or earnings, or a decrease in an economy's GDP during any quarter. Declining wage growth and a contraction of the money supply are characteristics of negative growth, and economists view negative growth as a sign of a possible recession or depression. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession of 2008 were the last times the U.S. economy experienced significant negative growth. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-growth.asp https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334633494",1,FALSE,1,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334633494

Gavin Newsom said, as he warned of the threat posed by President Donald Trump’s tariffs to the tech powerhouse’s fast-growing wealth. The Golden State’s nominal gross domestic product (GDP) reached $4.1 trillion in 2024, according to preliminary data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, edging past Japan’s $4.02 trillion nominal GDP in the same period as recorded by the International Monetary Fund. That means only the United States, China and Germany have larger economies than California, which outpaced all three countries with growth of 6% last year, according to the release. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334633212",2,FALSE,2,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334633212

Trump chose from the list, that's why he has a second tier Fox and Friends host as DoD Secretary. He won't get fired either. It's all about loyalty, which Trump conflates with merit. Rogan O’Handley, a.k.a. “DC Draino,” made his first appearance in the new media seat in the coveted federal space Monday, asking a question of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt that was more Trumpian propaganda regarding the potential death of habeas corpus than independent inquiry. “In [Donald] Trump’s first 99 days, we’ve seen a coordinated assault on the rule of law by radical judges,” O’Handley said. “These judges are providing more due process to violent MS-13 and Tren de Aragua illegal aliens than they did for American citizens who peacefully protested on January 6.” That is, of course, not true. Family members and friends of the deportees accused of being members of the violent Venezuelan gang claimed their loved ones had never been a part of Tren de Aragua. Further still, some of the men forced to board the planes had no criminal record—something that would not have slipped under the radar had they had their time in front of a judge. And of course, January 6 was by no means peaceful. O’Handley then went on to quote White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who claimed that it would be “ridiculous” to offer “full trials” for the 15 million immigrants who had crossed the border, presuming that they would all be kicked out of the country. Last week, Miller claimed that it would take “centuries” to remove immigrants from the country if the Trump administration were to abide by the Constitution in executing its mass deportation program. On Instagram, O’Handley insisted that his voice in the White House briefing room had tried to “provide solutions for doing mass deportations” rather than “complain.” The White House opened up its briefing room to “new media” in January, a category that encompasses professional journalists as well as podcasters, influencers, and other news-related content creators. In Trump’s second term, these special few are allowed the first opportunity to speak during each biweekly session, during which Leavitt will typically answer 15 to 20 questions. So far, some of the occupants of the “new media” chair have included content creators from Breitbart, the right-wing video platform Rumble, BreakingPoints, the Daily Wire, former Newsmax host Mark Halperin, and the right-wing substack Washington Reporter. The Trump administration announced in March that it would be conducting a total shakeup of the briefing room’s seating chart, bumping heads with the White House Correspondents’ Association—an independent group that has traditionally overseen seat assignments—as the Trump administration attempts to control who gets their questions answered. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334633209",3,FALSE,2,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334633209

In fact, they're only heating up. While the first era of DOGE firings continues to face legal issues, the next set could be on stronger footing. That's because agencies have the chance to craft more methodical plans. In particular, many are offering buyout-like deferred resignation plans for workers to voluntarily quit in exchange for months of paid administrative leave. These methods could prove to be on a more solid legal footing than the first round of firings, which focused on new or newly promoted workers, cited low performance ratings, and did not provide notice. It all means that the DOGE ethos is alive and well in the federal government, with or without Musk. https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-leaving-doge-firings-rifs-trump-federal-workforce-cuts-2025-4 https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334632992",0,TRUE,2,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334632992

Trump over the weekend posted several statements to his social media network, Truth Social. One comment from the President included bad news for his Republican allies. In another post, Trump said, ""I’m bringing Columbus Day back from the ashes."" ""The Democrats did everything possible to destroy Christopher Columbus, his reputation, and all of the Italians that love him so much. They tore down his Statues, and put up nothing but 'WOKE,' or even worse, nothing at all! Well, you’ll be happy to know, Christopher is going to make a major comeback,"" the President added. ""I am hereby reinstating Columbus Day under the same rules, dates, and locations, as it has had for all of the many decades before!"" Axios was quick to issue a ""reality check"" on Trump, reporting that Columbus Day ""never went anywhere."" ""A president cannot unilaterally erase or declare federal holidays — Congress is required for such a move — and Columbus Day is still a federal holiday, though Indigenous Peoples Day has replaced it in over 200 cities and multiple states as of last year,"" according to the outlet. PatriotTakes, which says it is dedicated to ""researching and monitoring"" right-wing extremism ""and other threats to democracy,"" responded, ""He was never here."" Political strategist Chris D. Jackson said, ""The fact is, Columbus Day never went anywhere."" ""But if I had approval ratings like you, I'd want to talk about anything else besides that too,"" Jackson added on X.

Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues, Huggies diapers, and Scott toilet-paper rolls, said the tariffs will add three hundred million dollars to its gross costs. Danaher, which makes medical and industrial devices, said the toll on its operations could be as much as three hundred and fifty million dollars. Small businesses, which, according to some studies, generate close to half of all economic activity in the U.S., don’t issue public reports, but countless restaurant owners, retailers, and car dealers are going through the same sorts of calculations. Meanwhile, the rest of us are starting to face higher prices for goods made abroad. Some sellers on Amazon have already raised their prices to reflect the new tariffs. So have the Chinese fast-fashion companies Shein and Temu, whose products are particularly popular with Gen Z-ers. https://forums.craigslist.org/?ID=334632670",0,TRUE,2,https://forums.craigslist.org/?act=Q&ID=334632670
